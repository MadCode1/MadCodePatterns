MadCodePatterns - Learn Pattern Printing in Python and C

Welcome to **MadCodePatterns**! This repository is your go-to resource for learning **pattern printing** in **Python** and **C**. Whether you're just starting out or looking to improve your **coding skills**, this repository is designed to help you understand various patterns such as **star patterns**, **diamond patterns**, **pyramid patterns**, **number patterns**, and more. Each pattern is implemented in both Python and C, making it perfect for beginners and intermediate programmers alike.

## Features

- **Diverse Patterns**: From simple **star patterns** to more complex **number patterns** and **diamond designs**.
- **Two Languages**: All patterns are implemented in **Python** and **C**, so you can learn the same concepts in both languages.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Ideal for newcomers to **programming** to learn the fundamentals of **pattern printing** and **algorithm development**.
- **Well-Documented Code**: Each program is clearly commented to help you understand the logic and flow.
- **Daily Updates**: New patterns are added regularly to keep you engaged and learning continuously.
